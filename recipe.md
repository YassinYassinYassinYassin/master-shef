firstly,you need to carry the 1000 houses of sugar on your pinky and get in one of your rockects, and empty the houses when you have reached the height of about 20000 miles above sea level, then you wil use your 900 bottles of whip cream as a jetpack and throw your 10 milk buckets on your cake, so far you are probably 100 miles above sea level and relize that you will fall, after you fall it will take about 10 years for recovery, but that ok because your almost done, all you need to do is throw the rest of your ingredients on the cake, IMPORTANT NOTE: dont crack the eggs before throwing them, it is best that they are intact
